## About

A bot built with JavaScript to interact with a Discord server. It was created to discover discordbots and practise JS.

Abdessamad can answer to some messages in your conversations in order to make you laugh, but he also has some useful features.

**This work is discontinued** since I have decided to [rewrite the bot in Python](https://github.com/nathanaelhoun/Abpyssathon)

## Features

* `!help` to see the help menu
* `ping` to play ping-pong with me
* `!activity [&show_history 'number'] / [&set 'activity']` to manage my activity
* `!hw &add / &show / &rm` to manage the homeworks
* `!int &add / &show / &rm` to manage the int points
* `!teams ['number'] ['@role']` to make random teams with the role's members
